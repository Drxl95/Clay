# Templating system

# Repositories
* Templates should live on repositories and follow a strict guideline (filenames, file structure etc...)
* Templates can be imported/updated from a repository URL
* Support for *any* git based repository
* Templates need an author, so we need a register/login system OR
* Github/gitlab social logins
* Maybe, later, popular template creators are allowed to post "premium" templates which require user to pay to edit them
